              <div class="answer" id="answer1">
                A: To reach Siargao, book a domestic flight to Sayak Airport
                from Cebu. If you prefer a scenic route, you can optionally take
                a ferry from Surigao City. Once you arrive, make arrangements
                for local transportation to your accommodation.

              </div>
              <div class="answer" id="answer2">
                A: It depends on what you’re looking for! September is by far
                the busiest month. The national & international surfing
                competitions and the town fiesta are all in September. If you’re
                looking for epic surf, the waves are best from September to
                November. If you’re looking for uncrowded surf, come from
                December to March. It’s uncrowded because it’s raining. A lot.
                If you want to learn how to surf, come anytime. If you have no
                idea why everyone keeps talking about surfing, then April to
                October are perfect for beach all day and party all night.
